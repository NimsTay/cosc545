Hi! I'm planning on looking at these two works by Franz Kafka for works by the same author.

https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5200 -- Metamorphosis
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849 -- The Trial

For the analysis between authors I'll look at Metamorphosis above, and The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde below

https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/174 -- The Picture of Dorian Gray

For question 3, I don't expect the words the authors used to be significantly different, except maybe the name of main characters in the books. Please let me know if you have any questions.
